solarized-konsole
======================

Finally, a correctly implemented solarized theme for konsole.

Why This Exists
---------------

All of the solarized themes for konsole I found had these issues.

 - Colors were incorrectly ordered.
 - Using [Ethan Schoonover's](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) vim configuration files exacerbated above problem.

Using this solarized theme for konsole should result in better integration with Ethan Schoonover's vim files.

Installation
------------

Copy the .colorscheme file into ```~/.kde/share/apps/konsole/```.

TO DO
-----

 - Light variant.
 - Fix blue cursor in vim.
